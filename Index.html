                <p>
                    We are Weekly Wave, the one and only start-up made by 3 young enthusiasts. So imagine you are close to your final year exams, suddenyly one of your friends call you and tells you "I have an amazing idea guys!!" Then you as person, 
                    in shock would say "Whaatt!??". So exactly that is what happened, from starting our idea in May with a weekly email newsletter, to expanding and focusing on teenagers knowledge on the questions on their heads that was impossible for them to search, that's why we call ourselves <b>Random, Useful, Articles</b>, Now by knowing this you can interpret pretty much our history, 
                    not long before but made in May 2023, Young generation <italics>Amirali</italics>
